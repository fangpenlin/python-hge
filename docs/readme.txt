To compile this pyhge, you have to install boost.python

You can get precompiled binrary library installer here:

http://www.boostpro.com/download

And also, you need HGE, too.

Download hge from http://hge.relishgames.com/ and unzip it under trunk, for example

checkout trunk to G:\pyhge, and you will see following folders
G:\pyhge\src 
G:\pyhge\docs

and you have to put the hge folder to
G:\pyhge\hge

If you don't want to put the folder there, you can just modify the configuration of visual c++ project
